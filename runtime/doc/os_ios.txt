					*ios* *iOS* *iPhone* *iPad*

This file documents the particularities of the iOS version of Vim.

NOTE: The virtual keyboard on iOS doesn't have an Esc key. The Esc key has
been mapped to the backslash key. You can customize this to fit your taste.

1. General                      |ios-general|
2. User interface               |ios-ui|
3.  File sharing         |ios-filesharing|

Vim on the iOS has been made possible by Applidium, http://applidium.com, with
some additional help by others; see https://github.com/applidium/Vim.

==============================================================================
1. General	               				*ios-general*

Vim on iOS behaves much like other unix versions, but some restrictions apply:
 - Vim is running in a sandbox. You can only edit files within the $HOME
   directory. Other files are accessible read-only.
 - Unfortunately, Vim cannot start (nor ship with) any external binary. This
   is a limitation of the iOS SDK, and cannot be worked around.

==============================================================================
2. User interface	        			*ios-ui*

The iOS virtual keyboard lacks many keys (Esc, Control, Meta, Alt to name a
few). Some people make the decision to add an extra row of keys, but we
decided that Vim was flexible enough to work with only the system keyboard.
This leaves more screen real-estate for the actual text.

However, a long-press on the main screen provides at least an escape key.

Using an external keyboard greatly improves the experience. Most keyboard
commands are supported, most notably ESC, CTRL-[, CTRL-W, CTRL-E, etc..

Mouse events are fully supported. Clicking with a single
finger will generate a click event. Panning with one finger will generate
scrollwheel events. Panning with two fingers will
generate drag events. When scrolling on the
iPhone, the keyboard will be hidden to make more room for the text.

iOS Vim is compatible with the split view and slide over features in iOS 9.
==============================================================================
3. File sharing	        			*ios-filesharing* *ios-itunes*

Getting files in and out of Vim follows the standard iOS scheme: From any app
you can copy a file to Vim via the "Open In" dialog.
To export a file from Vim, invoke the :Share command. This will open an export
dialog, with which you can export to most apps and also via Airdrop.

Of course you can also use iTunes. Using a
simple drag'n'drop gesture, you can add (or remove) files from your $HOME
directory straight from iTunes. Just navigate to your iOS device, go in the
'Apps' tab, and select 'Vim' at the bottom of the window.
